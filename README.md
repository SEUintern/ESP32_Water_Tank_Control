# ESP32_Water_Tank_Control

## Executive Summary
The project focuses on modernizing the traditional electrical panel board of water tank by integrating advanced ESP-32 based electronic controller. The conventional panel boards have limitations in terms of efficiency, safety, and functionality. By transitioning to electronic controllers, we aim to enhance the management, monitoring, and control of water tank systems, ultimately improving user experience and resource utilization. 


## Project Goals

- Enhance controllability 100%* by offering finer control over various parameters such as water levels, valve position, motor status at the end of the first month.  
- Reduced Size and Weight of the system by 10%* replacing purely electrical counterparts by electronic components. 
- Increase flexibility by 10%* in terms of functionality and adaptability by making it easy to accommodate changes in requirements or technological advancements at the end of the first month. 
- Advancing features enable the implementation of advanced features and functionalities such as wireless communication and real time monitoring. 
- Reducing the cost 10%* by reducing energy consumption, lowering maintenance requirements. 


## Project Deliverables

- ESP 32 based electronic automation system to replace current electrical system.  
- Real-time status monitoring android mobile application.  
- Basic training program for the staff to adopt with new technology. 
- User manual and project report documents.


## Benefits

- Enhance controllability (More Controllable Parameters)  
- Lower weight and size (Reduced Size and Weight)  
- More Flexibility (Easy to accommodate changes)  
- Lower Running cost (lower energy consumption and maintenance requirements)  


## CONCLUSION 

Replacing manual electrical controller with automatic electronic controller for water tank management represents a significant advancement in energy efficiency, sustainability, and resilience. Adapting to modern technology leads to optimizing resource utilization and reducing operating costs. Our commitment to environmental sustainability, economic viability, and social impact represents our dedication to creating a sustainable future for our organization and the communities we serve. With a focus on innovation, collaboration, and continuous improvement, we are poised to unlock new opportunities and drive positive change in every aspect. Together, we embark on this journey towards a more efficient, sustainable, and resilient future.
